## ü§ñ ABOUT

</div>

The BUGTRONS 2.0, revamped version of [BUGTRONS](https://github.com/devstrons/bugtrons), is a student-run contest, organized with the collaboration of two tremendous tech-lead communities:-

- [DEVSTRONS'](https://devstrons.bio.link/): Student-run Open source, inclusive & diverse community intending towards learning together and making opportunities.

- [Learn With Community](https://learnwithcommunity.bio.link): A tech community, focusing on the best way to learn, learning together.

> "Competition makes us faster. Collaboration makes us better"

We aim to target community folks and make them aware of the Ed-tech industry by putting emphasis on problem-solving, code efficiency, code optimization, and logic-based programming.

We empower hackers to get influenced by developing software, enhancing skills, solving bugs & producing opportunities.
