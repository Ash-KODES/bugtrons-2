## Round 1: DSA basic round

All the participants are to abide by the following Code of Conduct:

1. You should not have multiple accounts on Hackerrank. If you have, then you should delete all except one.

2. If you encounter any issue during an ongoing contest, post it as a message on the [DEVSTRONS](https://discord.gg/MVujzTBqed) Discord server. The problem setter will help you get over it.

3. You should avoid sharing formulae, logic, or any other significant aspect of your code during a contest. If our plagiarism algorithm finds striking similarities between your code and someone elseâ€™s, your account may stand the risk of being suspended.

4. If you are taking part in Hackerrankâ€™s contests, you must take good care of your code. Protect it from getting leaked, getting shared, and getting copied by your foes, friends, or just a random peer. It is your responsibility to provide it with the safety it deserves.

5. Unless specified otherwise, you are expected to solve and code the problems yourself and not discuss them with others.

6. Stay honest with the community. If you come across any wrongdoing, which hampers the decorum of the community on or off it, do report that to us. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate action to stop it.

7. Do not obfuscate the code.

8. Indulging in any dishonest means leads to disqualification.
