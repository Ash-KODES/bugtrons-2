# ðŸ“° CODE OF CONDUCT
   
<!-- 
! Joshith, make all these points as numbered lists
 -->

## Round 1: DSA basic round 
The Participants should abide with these Code of Conduct. Here are they: <!-- !Joshith, correct this line according to you -->
 - You should not have multiple accounts on Hackerrank. If you have, then you should delete all except one.
 - If you encounter any issue during an ongoing contest, post it as a message on the [DEVSTRONS](https://discord.com/invite/MVujzTBqed) discord server. The problem setter will help you get over it.
 - You should avoid sharing formulae, logic, or any other significant aspect of your code during a contest. If our plagiarism algorithm finds striking similarities between your code and someone elseâ€™s, your account may stand the risk of being suspended.
 - If you are taking part in Hackerrankâ€™s contests, you must take good care of your code. Protect it from getting leaked, getting shared, and getting copied by your foes, friends, or just a random peer. It is your responsibility to provide it the safety it deserves.
 - Unless specified otherwise, you are expected to solve and code the problems yourself and not discuss with others.
 - Stay honest to the community. If you come across any wrongdoing, which hampers the decorum of the community on or off it, do report that to us. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate action to stop it.
 - You write beautiful codes. Why ruin it by obfuscating it? Keep the real beauty of the code intact. Do not obfuscate it.
 - Do not try any dishonest means to move up the rank tables.
